# Grading System Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **API Key Formatting Issue** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: The Anthropic API key in `.env` and `.env.local` files was split across multiple lines
- **Impact**: This caused all grading to fall back to mock data instead of using the real Claude API
- **Solution**: Fixed the API key to be on a single line in all environment files

### 2. **Rate Limiting Protection** ✅ ADDED
- **Problem**: The "Grade Ungraded" button was processing all submissions sequentially without rate limiting
- **Impact**: Could hit API rate limits when grading many submissions
- **Solution**: Added batch processing with delays:
  - Processes 5 submissions at a time
  - 2-second delay between batches
  - Better error handling for individual failures

### 3. **API Key Validation** ✅ IMPROVED
- **Problem**: Inadequate validation of API key format
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive validation:
  - Checks if key starts with `sk-ant-`
  - Verifies key length > 50 characters
  - Ensures it's not the placeholder value
  - Provides clear logging when falling back to mock data

## How to Verify the Fix

### 1. Check Grading Status
Visit: `http://localhost:3000/api/debug/grading-status`

This will show:
- API key validation status
- Number of graded/ungraded submissions
- Recent submission grading status
- Recommendations for next steps

### 2. Test Automatic Grading
1. Submit a new rubric through the application
2. Check the server logs for grading messages
3. Verify the submission is automatically graded (not using mock data)

### 3. Grade Backlog
1. Go to the admin panel
2. Click "Grade Ungraded" button
3. Monitor progress - it will process in batches of 5

## Important Notes

1. **Restart Required**: You must restart your development server for the API key fix to take effect:
   ```bash
   # Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Monitoring**: Watch the server logs for any API errors or rate limiting issues

3. **Backup Created**: The fix script created backups of your environment files with timestamps

## If Issues Persist

1. Check the API key is valid:
   - Visit `http://localhost:3000/api/debug/grading-status`
   - Look at the `apiKeyStatus` section

2. Check for API errors in server logs:
   - Look for "Error grading prompt" or "Error grading submission" messages

3. Verify the Anthropic API key is active and has credits:
   - Log into console.anthropic.com
   - Check your API usage and limits

## Technical Details

### Files Modified:
1. `/src/app/api/admin/check-ungraded/route.ts` - Added batch processing and rate limiting
2. `/src/app/api/submissions/route.ts` - Improved API key validation
3. `/src/app/api/debug/grading-status/route.ts` - New diagnostic endpoint
4. `.env` and `.env.local` - Fixed API key formatting

### Key Changes:
- API key validation now checks format, length, and ensures it's not a placeholder
- Batch processing prevents overwhelming the API with concurrent requests
- Better error logging helps diagnose issues quickly
